## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game started as a **solo project**, driven by my passion for creating **fast-paced, reflex-driven** games. I wanted to develop a game that challenges players with precise controls and **engaging endless gameplay**.

The combination of **jumping and shooting mechanics** made for an interesting gameplay loop that required both **quick decision-making** and **sharp reflexes**. The goal was to design a game that keeps players coming back, trying to **beat their high scores** while improving their skills.

Developing this game was an exciting challenge, particularly in balancing **difficulty scaling** and ensuring smooth cross-platform performance on both **Windows and Android**. Every aspect, from controls to level design, was fine-tuned to make the experience as engaging as possible.
